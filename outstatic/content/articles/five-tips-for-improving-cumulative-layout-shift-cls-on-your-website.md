Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric that measures the stability of a website's layout. It is an important factor in the user experience of a website, as unexpected layout shifts can be jarring and disrupt the user's ability to interact with the page. In this post, we will discuss some techniques for optimizing and improving CLS on your website.

One of the main causes of layout shifts is the use of dynamically-sized elements on the page. These elements can change size, causing other elements on the page to shift around. To avoid this, it is important to specify the size of these elements in advance, using CSS. This can be done using the `width` and `height` properties, or by using a layout method such as `flexbox` or `grid`.

Another common cause of layout shifts is the use of images or other media elements that are not properly sized. If an image is larger than the container it is placed in, it can cause the rest of the layout to shift as the image is loaded. To prevent this, it is important to specify the size of images in advance, either by using the `width` and `height` attributes or by using CSS.

Another technique for improving CLS is to ensure that all of the resources on your page are loaded as efficiently as possible. This includes optimizing images, using server-side rendering, and minimizing the number of HTTP requests that are made.

It is also important to properly prioritize the loading of resources on your page. By prioritizing the loading of critical resources, you can ensure that the layout of the page is stable as soon as possible, minimizing any unexpected shifts.

Finally, it is a good idea to test your website's CLS using tools such as Google's PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse. These tools will provide you with a CLS score and suggestions for improvement, making it easier to identify and fix any issues.

In conclusion, optimizing and improving CLS is an important part of improving the user experience of your website. By specifying the size of dynamically-sized elements, properly sizing images and media, optimizing resource loading, prioritizing the loading of critical resources, and using testing tools, you can minimize unexpected layout shifts and improve the stability of your website's layout.

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric that measures the stability of a website's layout. Here are five ways to improve and optimize CLS:

1. Specify the size of dynamically-sized elements: One of the main causes of layout shifts is the use of dynamically-sized elements on the page. To avoid this, it is important to specify the size of these elements in advance, using CSS. This can be done using the `width` and `height` properties, or by using a layout method such as `flexbox` or `grid`.

2. Properly size images and media: Another common cause of layout shifts is the use of images or other media elements that are not properly sized. To prevent this, it is important to specify the size of images in advance, either by using the `width` and `height` attributes or by using CSS.

3. Optimize resource loading: Ensuring that all of the resources on your page are loaded as efficiently as possible can help improve CLS. This includes optimizing images, using server-side rendering, and minimizing the number of HTTP requests that are made.

4. Prioritize the loading of critical resources: Properly prioritizing the loading of resources on your page can ensure that the layout of the page is stable as soon as possible, minimizing any unexpected shifts.

5. Test using tools: It is a good idea to test your website's CLS using tools such as Google's PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse. These tools will provide you with a CLS score and suggestions for improvement, making it easier to identify and fix any issues.
