Async and Await are two of the most popular language features in JavaScript that make it easier to write and read asynchronous code. Async and Await are built on top of Promises, which are a pattern for dealing with async operations in JavaScript.

Async and await provide a way to write async code that looks and behaves like sync code. This means that you can write asynchronous code that looks like it's executing in a linear fashion and do not have to worry about the complexities of callbacks and chaining Promises.

Here's an example of how you can use Async and Await to perform an async operation in JavaScript:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

getData()
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In this example, the getData function is an async function that uses await to wait for the Promise returned by the fetch function to resolve. The await keyword can only be used inside an async function and pauses execution until that Promise resolves.

Once the Promise has been resolved, the async function continues executing and returns the resolved value. In this case, the returned value is JSON data that was received from an API.

Once the Promise has been resolved, the async function continues executing and returns the resolved value. In this case, the returned value is JSON data that was received from an API.

Another thing to note is that Async and Await are not a replacement for Promises; they are functions that make it easier to work with Promises. Under the hood, Async and Await still use Promises to perform their async operations, and you can use Promises and Async/Await together in your code.

Async and Await are two language features in JavaScript that make it easier to write and read asynchronous code. They are built on top of Promises and provide a higher-level syntax that makes dealing with async operations more readable and maintainable. If you are working with async code in JavaScript, it is worth learning how to use these new language features to make your code more readable and maintainable.
